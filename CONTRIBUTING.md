## ðŸ§  Coding Style

- Bash scripts should be POSIX-compliant where possible.
- Use `#!/bin/bash` and `set -euo pipefail` for safety.
- Document your functions and input params.

## âœ… Ground Rules

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Ask if you're unsure â€” we donâ€™t gatekeep here.
- New ideas are welcome. So are wild ones.

Thanks for making `banditctl-tools` better ðŸ’ª  
Together, we break limits. One shell script at a time.
