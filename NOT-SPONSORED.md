# 🔥 Engineered by Bandit – Not Sponsored

This project is proudly **independent**. No sponsors. No external agendas. Just code, tools, and automation — built by rebels, for rebels.

---

## 🚫 No Sponsorships

* No paid promotions
* No affiliate links
* No feature paywalls
* No product placement

I believe in:

* 🧬 Open-source ethics
* 🧠 Knowledge without gatekeeping
* 💻 Tools that **you** control, not some cloud dashboard

---

## 🧠 Why it matters

The internet is full of tutorials sponsored by vendors. That’s cool — but this isn’t that. Every script, config, and line here exists because it works, not because someone paid for it.

This repo was built with:

* ☕ coffee-fueled deep dives
* 🛠️ nights of tinkering
* 🧼 an obsession for repo hygiene

> If it’s here, it’s trusted. If it’s broken, I’ll fix it. If it’s sponsored… it’s not here.
